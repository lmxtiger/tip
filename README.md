**tip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **MINXUAN LIU**

Time spent: **12 or more** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Yes] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [Yes] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [NO] UI animations
* [NO] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [NO] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [Yes] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- There is a "reset to default" button on the settings page that allows the user to reset the 3 options of tip percentage back to the default values: 15%, 18%, and 20%. In addition, when the user presses the button, the background color (by default of opaque separator color) will change to white to tell the user it is being pressed. The author of this app is still working on new features!

## Notes

I'm new to the IOS mobile app development but have experience with Android. The development of this simple tip calculator was quite smooth, except there are occasions where I had a a little trouble navigating through xcode the IDE. After finshing this app, I definitely feel more familiar with xcode functionalities and layout. I did a lot of research by googling and reading stackoverflow posts relevant to the topic and in return added a few new features to this app.
